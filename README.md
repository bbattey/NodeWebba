Create Generative Music with Variable-Coupled Map Networks

Bret Battey / Bat Hat Media

Nodewebba is generative music software in which a web of feedback-based pattern generators creates dynamic, interlocking melodic and rhythmic patterns. It brings my concept of Variable-Coupled Map Networks (VCMN) out of the research lab and into the home studio.

I created Nodewebba using Cycling74's Max 6.
